# Introduction: The Need for Embedded Databases in Language Models

</div>

Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of natural language understanding and generation. However, their reliance on pre-trained data has inherent limitations, particularly in the face of rapidly evolving information in the digital age. These models, such as the notable GPT-3.5, require extensive training on vast datasets, which often incur substantial computational expenses and, more critically, run the risk of becoming outdated even before they hit commercial availability.

A prime example of this challenge is the GPT-3.5 model, which had its training data up until 2021. The time and computational resources required to update such models with the most recent information are prohibitively expensive. Moreover, the environmental implications of continuously retraining massive language models cannot be understated.

In response to these challenges, a novel approach emerges: the integration of embedded databases, often referred to as vector databases, into the framework of LLMs. Unlike traditional databases, vector databases are engineered to store data in the form of embeddings, or vector representations. What sets them apart is their ability to store not just the data itself but also predefined indexes for efficient retrieval.

## Vector Databases: A Comprehensive Overview

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate vector data. These databases are particularly valuable in various fields, including data science, machine learning, computational material science, and more. They provide a powerful means of handling data with high dimensionality, making them especially useful in applications where traditional relational databases may fall short.

### Key Features of Embedded Databases (Vector Databases):

1. Storage of Indexes Alongside Embeddings: Vector databases go beyond mere data storage; they store precomputed indexes alongside the embeddings. When a query is made to the database, it doesn't need to scan the entire dataset. Instead, it employs methods like cosine similarity to swiftly locate the most relevant vectors based on the indexed information.

2. Efficient Retrieval: This embedded approach significantly accelerates the retrieval of relevant data, making it particularly suitable for LLMs seeking to extract information rapidly.

3. Updatability: Perhaps the most critical advantage is the capacity to update the database efficiently with new information. This means that as new data becomes available, it can be encoded into embeddings and incorporated into the database, all without the need for time-consuming and resource-intensive model retraining.

4. Source Attribution: An additional benefit is the possibility for LLMs to cite the source of the information they extract. Since the database stores indexed data, it becomes feasible for the language model to reference the specific source from which the information was retrieved.

5. Scalability: Vector databases are designed to scale horizontally to handle growing datasets and workloads. They can distribute data across multiple nodes or servers to ensure high availability and performance.

6. Support for High-Dimensional Data: Many real-world applications involve high-dimensional data, such as images, text embeddings, or sensor data. Vector databases are well-suited to handle such data types.

7. Diverse Applications: Vector databases find applications in recommendation systems, content-based searching, anomaly detection, clustering, and more.



## Using GPT-3.5 for Information Extraction with ChromaDB:

Now, let's discuss how GPT-3.5 can be used in conjunction with ChromaDB to extract information from color data. GPT-3.5, with its natural language understanding capabilities, can provide a user-friendly interface to query ChromaDB and retrieve relevant color information.

1. Natural Language Queries: Users can interact with GPT-3.5 by asking questions or providing descriptions in natural language. For example, "Find me colors similar to 'ocean blue'."

2. Semantic Understanding: GPT-3.5 can understand the context of the query and translate it into a search query for ChromaDB. It can also handle nuanced requests, such as finding colors with specific RGB values.

3. Contextual Insights: GPT-3.5 can provide additional information about the colors found, their applications, or their popularity in specific industries or design trends.

4. Integration with Applications: Developers can integrate GPT-3.5 and ChromaDB into applications, allowing users to discover and explore color data effortlessly.
